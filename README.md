# Maya Selection Isolation Tool

This script for Autodesk Maya prevents **accidental selection of other objects** when switching to component modes (vertex, edge, face) on a selected object.

It works by temporarily isolating the selected object(s): all other objects are placed into a display layer (`sw_oc_other`) and made unselectable (`reference`). This ensures you only interact with what you intended â€” nothing else.

## ðŸ”‘ Purpose

âœ… **Avoid unwanted selection** of other objects when working in component mode  
âœ… **Stay focused** on the currently selected object  
âœ… **Quickly toggle** between object and component modes using hotkeys

---

## ðŸ§© Features

- Hotkey-based switching:
  - `Object Mode`
  - `Vertex Mode`
  - `Edge Mode`
  - `Face Mode`
- Isolates only the selected object(s)
- Unselected objects become `reference` (unselectable)
- `Object Mode` removes the isolation layer
- Toggle between `reference` and `template` for the isolation layer


# Install

1. Download the SwitchObjectComponentMode.py and place the SwitchObjectComponentMode.py file in your Maya scripts directory.

2. Assign a Hotkey with the following python code:

## Object Mode
```python
import SwitchObjectComponentMode as SwitchOCMode
SwitchOCMode.ObjectMode()
```
## Vertex Mode
```python
import SwitchObjectComponentMode as SwitchOCMode
SwitchOCMode.VertexMode()
```
## Edge Mode
```python
import SwitchObjectComponentMode as SwitchOCMode
SwitchOCMode.EdgeMode()
```
## Face Mode
```python
import SwitchObjectComponentMode as SwitchOCMode
SwitchOCMode.FaceMode()
```

## Toggle Templated Mode
```python
import SwitchObjectComponentMode as SwitchOCMode
SwitchOCMode.ToggleTemplatedMode()
```
