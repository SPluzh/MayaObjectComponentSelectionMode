##Select components only from current object

These scripts allow you to edit only the selected objects in component mode without switching to other objects. This allows you to modify only the selected components, making editing easier and reducing the risk of accidentally modifying other objects. At the same time, the scripts do not allow objects to be selected in component mode, ensuring that you work only in object mode.
